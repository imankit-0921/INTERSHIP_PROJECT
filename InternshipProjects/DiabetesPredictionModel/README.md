# DiabetesPrediction

This project is a diabetes prediction model that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person has diabetes based on several input factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The model was built using [algorithm(s)].


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will install the necessary libraries for running the diabetes prediction model, including:

- `numpy`
- `flask`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`

Now you should be all set up to run the project!
